## What are Diffusion Models?

Several diffusion-based generative models have been proposed with similar ideas underneath, including diffusion probabilistic models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015), noise-conditioned score network (NCSN; Yang & Ermon, 2019), and denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM; Ho et al. 2020).

### Forward diffusion process

Given a data point sampled from a real data distribution $x_0 \sim q(x)$, let us define a forward diffusion process in which we add small amounts of Gaussian noise to the sample in $T$ steps, producing a sequence of noisy samples $x_1, \ldots, x_T$. The step sizes are controlled by a variance schedule $\{{\beta_t \in (0,1)\}}_{{t=1}}^T$. The data sample $x_0$ gradually loses its distinguishable features as the step $t$ becomes larger. Eventually, when $T \rightarrow \infty$, $x_T$ is equivalent to an isotropic Gaussian distribution.

A nice property of the above process is that we can sample $x_t$ at any arbitrary time step $t$ in a closed form using the reparameterization trick. Let $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$ and $\bar{{\alpha}}_t = \prod_{{i=1}}^t \alpha_i$:

$$ \text{{merges two Gaussians (\*)}}. $$

(\*) Recall that when we merge two Gaussians with different variances, $N(0, \sigma_1^2 I)$ and $N(0, \sigma_2^2 I)$, the new distribution is $N(0, (\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2) I)$. Here the merged standard deviation is $(1 - \alpha_t) + \alpha_t (1 - \alpha_{{t-1}}) = 1 - \alpha_t \alpha_{{t-1}}$. Usually, we can afford a larger update step when the sample gets noisier, so $\beta_1 < \beta_2 < \cdots < \beta_T$ and therefore $\bar{{\alpha}}_1 > \cdots > \bar{{\alpha}}_T$.

#### Connection with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics

Langevin dynamics is a concept from physics, developed for statistically modeling molecular systems. Combined with stochastic gradient descent, stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (Welling & Teh 2011) can produce samples from a probability density $p(x)$ using only the gradients $\nabla_x \log p(x)$ in a Markov chain of updates:

$$ x\_{{t+1}} = x_t + \frac{{\delta}}{{2}} \nabla_x \log p(x_t) + \epsilon_t $$

where $\delta$ is the step size. When $T \rightarrow \infty, \epsilon \rightarrow 0, x_T$ equals to the true probability density $p(x)$. Compared to standard SGD, stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics injects Gaussian noise into the parameter updates to avoid collapses into local minima.

### Reverse diffusion process

If we can reverse the above process and sample from $q(x_{{t-1}} | x_t)$, we will be able to recreate the true sample from a Gaussian noise input, $x_T \sim N(0, I)$. Note that if $\beta_t$ is small enough, $q(x_{{t-1}} | x_t)$ will also be Gaussian. Unfortunately, we cannot easily estimate $q(x_{{t-1}} | x_t)$ because it needs to use the entire dataset, and therefore we need to learn a model $p_\theta$ to approximate these conditional probabilities in order to run the reverse diffusion process.

![Fig. 3. An example of training a diffusion model for modeling a 2D swiss roll data. (Image source: Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015)](path/to/image.png)

It is noteworthy that the reverse conditional probability is tractable when conditioned on $x_0$:

$$ q(x*{{t-1}} | x_t, x_0) \propto q(x_t | x*{{t-1}}, x*0) q(x*{{t-1}} | x_0) $$

Using Bayes' rule, we have:

$$ q(x*{{t-1}} | x_t, x_0) = \frac{{q(x_t | x*{{t-1}}, x*0) q(x*{{t-1}} | x_0)}}{{q(x_t | x_0)}} $$

where $C(x_t, x_0)$ is some function not involving $x_{{t-1}}$ and details are omitted. Following the standard Gaussian density function, the mean and variance can be parameterized as follows (recall that $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$ and $\bar{{\alpha}}_t = \prod_{{i=1}}^T \alpha_i$):

$$ \mu*\theta(x_t, t) = \frac{{1}}{{\sqrt{{\alpha_t}}}} (x_t - \frac{{\beta_t}}{{\sqrt{{1 - \bar{{\alpha}}\_t}}}} \epsilon*\theta(x_t, t)) $$

Thanks to the nice property, we can represent $x_0 = \frac{{1}}{{\bar{{\alpha}}_t}} (x_t - \alpha_t \epsilon_t)$ and plug it into the above equation and obtain:

$$ q(x*{{t-1}} | x_t, x_0) = \mathcal{{N}}(x*{{t-1}}; \mu*\theta(x_t, t), \sigma^2*\theta(x_t, t) I) $$

As demonstrated in Fig. 2., such a setup is very similar to VAE, and thus we can use the variational lower bound to optimize the negative log-likelihood. It is also straightforward to get the same result using Jensen's inequality.
